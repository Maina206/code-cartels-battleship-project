## Description 
This project is a Battleship game simulation where two players take turns attacking each other's ships on a 10x10 grid. The game includes key scenarios such as:
1. **Hit scenario**: Where a player successfully hits the opponent's ship.
2. **Sink scenario**: Where all parts of a ship are hit, causing it to sink.
3. **Loss scenario**: Where a player loses the game by having all their ships sunk.
4. **End game scenario**: One player wins when they sink all of the opponent's ships, and the other player loses.

## Project setup 
### Battleship Game
The challenge involved creating a Battleship game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players place ships on their respective grids, and the game tracks hits, misses, and sinking of ships. The game ends when all of one player's ships are sunk, declaring the other player the winner.

- Ships are placed on the shipboard and attacks are marked on the pinboard.
- Ships can be placed either horizontally or vertically.
- Visual feedback is provided for hits, misses, and sinking ships.
- The game implements win/loss conditions when all ships are sunk.

## Installation requirements
